        <h2>Recap of Chapter II</h2>
        <p>While driving home from work, he noticed a sign promising him great riches. He walked to the place of the sign and saw a shop. The shopkeeper is beautiful. The shopkeeper promises the player great riches, just as the sign said. The shopkeeper has a few cards on his stall. The player chooses to buy the cheapest one. It acts as a key to one of the shopkeeper's friend's places. Where does it go?</p>
    </p>
    <p class="narrator">Now, the player is at the shop.</p>
    <p class="player">What do you mean figure it out yourself?</p>
    <p class="shopkeeper">I can't reveal the location. It's your job!</p>
    <p class="player">Wait what?! Can you at least give me a hint?</p>
    <p class="shopkeeper">Look at the back of the key!</p>
    <p class="player">*thinking* What back of the key? Yk what, I'll look at it at home.</p>
    <p class="narrator">The player goes to drive home. He arrives.</p>
    <p class="player">OK, now to check the back of the key.</p>
    <p class="narrator">
        The key says: Twenty five, thirteen, twenty five quarter north.
        Fifty one, thirty three, fourty four, nine tenths east.
    </p>
    <p class="player">Sounds like a GPS code to me!</p>
    <p class="narrator">The player dials his friend.</p>
    <p class="player">
        Bro... I just bought the cheapest card at that guy's store. He said it was 
        a magic key that led somewhere. The back of the key says "Twenty five, thirteen, twenty five
        quarter north. Fifty one, thirty three, fourty four, nine tenths east."
    </p>
    <p class="playerfriend">Sounds like a GPS code.</p>
    <p class="player">EXACTLY!</p>
    <p class="playerfriend">The coordinates are 25&deg;13'25&frac14;" N, 51&deg;33'44.9" E.</p>
