    <p class="narrator">
        The player goes to the card shop again, this time finding another card unlocking another 
        experiment of the shopkeeper's friend's lab. He then buys the card and calls the shopkeeper's friend again.
        The shopkeeper's friend tells the player to come to the lab. The player arrives at the lab and the 
        shopkeeper's friend tells him about what the card he bought does. It gives an unactivated drone (
        the player needed to go to the lab). The friend says he has to pay some money to activate it. He 
        also tells the player that the drone has an immense power to press keys on the keyboard. Plus,
        the player can pay more money to make the drone work faster. The player pays the cash, activating
        the drone. The next day, instead of going to work, he sends the drone off to his workstation. The drone 
        types, and types, and types. Not long later, the boss calls the player asking him about the drone taking 
        his workstation. The player convinces the boss that it isn't illegal. Boss complies, the end.
