    <h2 class="narrator">Recap of Chapter IV</h2>
    <p class="narrator">
        The player goes to the card shop again, this time finding another card unlocking another 
        experiment of the shopkeeper's friend's lab. He then buys the card and calls the shopkeeper's friend again.
        The shopkeeper's friend tells the player to come to the lab. The player arrives at the lab and the 
        shopkeeper's friend tells him about what the card he bought does. It gives an unactivated drone (
        the player needed to go to the lab). The friend says he has to pay some money to activate it. He 
        also tells the player that the drone has an immense power to press keys on the keyboard. Plus,
        the player can pay more money to make the drone work faster. The player pays the cash, activating
        the drone. The next day, instead of going to work, he sends the drone off to his workstation. The drone 
        types, and types, and types. Not long later, the boss calls the player asking him about the drone taking 
        his workstation. The player convinces the boss that it isn't illegal. Boss complies, the end.
    </p>
    <p class="narrator">
        It has been a week or two since the last chapter. The player really enjoys slacking off work cause of his 
        drone. The player is at home right now gaming. Plus, he is pretty rich now, thanks to the drone.
    </p>
    <p class="player">
        So glad I got that drone... now I can do <b>WHATEVER</b> I WANT!!! I could do... PRINGLES MUKBANG!
        Or... MINECRAFT SPEEDRUN! (gasp) Maybe a MINECRAFT SPEEDRUN <b>WHILE</b> DOING PRINGLES MUKBANG!!! 
        Jeez, I should calm down. I just can't wait! 
    </p>
    <p class="narrator">The player's neighbor hears his monologue of rejoice.</p>
    <p class="narrator">Neighbor: Dude, shut up! I was gonna get victory royale! I lost my focus cuz of you!</p>
    <p class="player">Oh, sorry!</p>
    <p class="narrator">Neighbor: No problem! I can always try again.</p>
    <p class="player">Thank goodness you aint mad or anything...</p>
    <p class="narrator">Just then he gets a new call. It's the shopkeeper's friend.</p>
    <p class="player">What do you want?</p>
    <p class="shopkeeperfriend"><b>NEW CARD IN STOCK!!!</b></p>
    <p class="player">Aight, I'll go there later. OK?</p>
    <p class="shopkeeperfriend">OK, bye!</p>
    <p class="narrator">The player hangs up. Two hours later, he goes to the card shop. </p>
    <p class="shopkeeper">Yo, yo, yo! Guess what we have today??</p>
    <p class="player">Huh... something related to that Neuralink machine... I love it!</p>
    <p class="shopkeeper">Oh, thanks for the appreciation, and YOU'RE RIGHT!</p>
    <p class="player"><b>WOO!</b> So what about Neuralink is there?</p>
    <p class="shopkeeper">Me and friend have been discussing a few things, and we decided to</p>
    <p class="shopkeeperfriend"><b>MAKE A CARD THAT MAKES NEURALINK GIVE YOU A PROMOTION!</b></p>
    <p class="shopkeeper">Gosh, don't say it so loud, but he's right.</p>
    <p class="player">Cool. How much?</p>
    <p class="shopkeeper">Five hundos.</p>
    <p class="shopkeeperfriend">(in a whispering tone) <i>500 points.</i></p>
    <p class="player">Alright then! Let's do this!</p>
    <p class="narrator">The player pays the cash. </p>
    <p class="shopkeeperfriend">Now, you memorized where the lab was? </p>
    <p class="player">No...</p>
    <p class="shopkeeperfriend">No problem. Follow me!</p>
    <p class="narrator">They walk to the lab. Then they enter.</p>
    <p class="player">So yeah, what about Neuralink is this third card about?</p>
    <p class="shopkeeperfriend">It gives you a promotion. I already told you!</p>
    <p class="player">Nice.</p>
    <p class="shopkeeperfriend">You know how it works, right?</p>
    <p class="player">
        <b>This</b> I actually remember. The Neuralink will mind-control my boss. Wait a few hours while the 
        Neuralink is doing its thing. Then the next day, Neuralink will be done and a promotion is waiting!
    </p>
    <p class="shopkeeperfriend">Alright now, go home.</p>
    <p class="player">Later, alligator.</p>
    <p class="narrator">
        Player leaves the lab; the shopkeeper's friend activates the machine. Hours later, it finishes its work.
        The next day, he decides to go to work instead of slacking off for a change. He arrives at the office.
        At the middle of his shift, boss calls the player to his office; player enters. 
    </p>
    <p class="boss">
        Hey, hey, hey. Let's keep this private, OK? Last time I told you about getting a better position, the 
        WHOLE BUILDING WENT <b>CRAZY</b>! 
    </p>
    <p class="player">Don't count on it. </p>
    <p class="narrator">Player and boss laugh. Two co-workers hear the commotion.</p>
    <p class="narrator">Co-worker 1: What is this? Lemme look...</p>
    <p class="narrator">Co-worker 2: Shall we check?</p>
    <p class="narrator">Co-worker 1: Yeah.</p>
    <p class="narrator">
        The coworkers go up front to the office, peeking through the glass door. They can barely work out 
        the conversation's words. Meanwhile, the player and boss continue their talk.
    </p>
    <p class="player">Is it another rank up in position?</p>
    <p class="boss">I've seen many of your skills these last few days. Those five years really helped, huh?</p>
    <p class="player">I guess...</p>
    <p class="boss">Cuz guess what? (he whispers in the ear of the player) <i>You're promoted.</i></p>
    <p class="player"><b>WOW! Can't believe it!</b> (thinking to himself) I always trust these cards.</p>
    <p class="boss"><b>SHUT UP! You blew our cover!</b> I might have to demote you for that...</p>
    <p class="player"><b>NO PLEASE DON'T DE&mdash;</b></p>
    <p class="boss">Lol JK.</p>
    <p class="player">You scared me!</p>
    <p class="narrator">The focus shifts back to the co-workers.</p>
    <p class="narrator">Co-worker 1: You heard that?</p>
    <p class="narrator">Co-worker 2: He got promoted.</p>
    <p class="narrator">Co-worker 1: Cool!</p>
    <p class="narrator">Focus shifts back to the boss and player.</p>
    <p class="boss">I actually <b>like</b> the celebration, one moment.</p>
    <p class="narrator">
        The boss grabs a party popper from his bag. <b>BOOM!</b> The popper makes a very loud noise.
    </p>
    <p class="boss">Hold my hand.</p>
    <p class="player">WHAT ON EARTH are you doing?!</p>
    <p class="narrator">The boss scurries out of the office dragging the player out with him.</p>
    <p class="boss"><b>Give applause to this guy &mdash; he got promoted!</b></p>
    <p class="narrator">The co-workers clap.</p>
    <p class="narrator">Co-worker 1: Dude, congrats!</p>
    <p class="player">Wow, thank you!</p>
    <p class="narrator">Co-worker 2: I always believed in you!</p>
    <p class="player">Thanks!</p>
    <p class="boss">And to celebrate, <b>go home everyone! WORK IS DONE FOR THE DAY!</b></p>
    <p class="narrator">It is only two hours before work would have ended for the day.</p>
    <p class="narrator">Co-worker 1: Wow, first time I ever went home early!</p>
    <p class="narrator">Co-worker 2: YAY, EARLY HOME TIME!</p>
    <p class="narrator">All the workers leave. Focus shifts to boss in his car.</p>
    <p class="boss">A worker like this comes once in a million years...</p>
    <p class="narrator">Boss cries a few tears of joy. To be continued...</p>
