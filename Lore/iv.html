        <h2>Recap of Chapter III</h2>
        <p>At a shop, the player bought a card. It mysteriously had a GPS code at the back. The player and his friend work together to decipher such thing. It didn't take very long. The duo discovers a secret laboratory one mile from the office. They go there. They meet a friend of the shopkeeper back at the shopkeeper. At the lab, the shopkeeper's friend notices the duo got the card. He shows the duo a device he invented called Neuralink. It has the power to trick the boss into giving the player a raise, but it will get more expensive over time. It also takes a few hours to work. The next day, the player goes to work. When his shift ends, the boss tells him he got a raise. The player leaves work proud. </p>
    </p>
    <p class="narrator">It has been a few days since the last chapter. The player is making a lot of money. He's at home right now.</p>
    <p class="player">I love Neuralink, makes me <b>rich!</b></p>
    <p class="player">I wonder if there are any other cards in store...</p>
    <p class="player">Ima go there after lunch...</p>
    <p class="narrator">After lunch, he goes to the card shop place again.</p>
    <p class="shopkeeper">Hello there, how can I help you?</p>
    <p class="player">Are there any new items in stock?</p>
    <p class="shopkeeper">Wait a sec... you look familiar!</p>
    <p class="player">Uh-huh! I was your second customer!</p>
    <p class="shopkeeper">That's great to know! And we do have new cards today.</p>
    <p class="player">Seems like there are only a few cards...</p>
    <p class="shopkeeper">Oh! I have a cool card for you!</p> 
    <p class="player">So what does it do?</p>
    <p class="shopkeeper">Gives you a drone that's only good at one thing...</p>
    <p class="player">What's the one good thing?</p>
    <p class="shopkeeper">Ha... you'll see...</p>
    <p class="player">Oh, you secretive shopkeeper...</p>
    <p class="shopkeeper">Go on, find out what it is!</p>
    <p class="player">OK...</p>
    <p class="shopkeeper">Bye!</p>
    <p class="narrator">The player leaves the shop, excited to find out what he meant by the drone.</p>
    <p class="player">Lemme see if his friend could help...</p>
    <p class="narrator">The player calls the shopkeeper's friend.</p>
    <p class="player">What's good bro!</p>
    <p class="shopkeeperfriend">Hi!!</p>
    <p class="player">I have the second card, he said it had something to do with a drone.</p>
    <p class="shopkeeperfriend">A drone, huh?</p>
    <p class="player">Yep, a drone.</p>
    <p class="shopkeeperfriend">Come to my lab again, I'll show you what he means.</p>
    <p class="player">Coming!</p>
    <p class="narrator">The player arrives at the lab.</p>
    <p class="player">Okay, so about the drones, why did you bring me here?</p>
    <p class="shopkeeperfriend">You need me to activate the drone.</p>
    <p class="player">Why did that shopkeeper give me a broken drone anyway?</p>
    <p class="shopkeeperfriend">IDK, that's just him!</p>
    <p class="player">Now can you fix this thing up?</p>
