        <h2>Recap of Chapter III</h2>
        <p>At a shop, the player bought a card. It mysteriously had a GPS code at the back. The player and his friend work together to decipher such thing. It didn't take very long. The duo discovers a secret laboratory one mile from the office. They go there. They meet a friend of the shopkeeper back at the shopkeeper. At the lab, the shopkeeper's friend notices the duo got the card. He shows the duo a device he invented called Neuralink. It has the power to trick the boss into giving the player a raise, but it will get more expensive over time. It also takes a few hours to work. The next day, the player goes to work. When his shift ends, the boss tells him he got a raise. The player leaves work proud. </p>
    </p>
    <p class="narrator">It has been a few days since the last chapter. The player has used Neuralink a few times since then. He's at home right now.</p>
    <p class="player">I love Neuralink, makes me <b>rich!</b></p>
    <p class="player">I wonder if there are any other cards in store...</p>
    <p class="player">Ima go there after lunch...</p>
    <p class="narrator">After lunch, he goes to the card shop place again.</p>
    <p class="shopkeeper">Hello there, how can I help you?</p>
    <p class="player">Are there any new items in stock?</p>
    <p class="shopkeeper">Wait a sec... you look familiar!</p>
    <p class="player">Uh-huh! I was your second customer!</p>
    <p class="shopkeeper">That's great to know! And we do have new cards today.</p>
    <p class="player">Seems like there are only a few cards...</p>
    <p class="shopkeeper">Oh! I have a cool card for you!</p> 
    <p class="player">So what does it do?</p>
    <p class="shopkeeper">Gives you a drone that's only good at one thing...</p>
    <p class="player">What's the one good thing?</p>
    <p class="shopkeeper">Ha... you'll see...</p>
    <p class="player">Oh, you secretive shopkeeper...</p>
    <p class="shopkeeper">It costs 200 points.</p>
    <p class="narrator">The player pays the money.</p>
    <p class="shopkeeper">Go on, find out what it is!</p>
    <p class="player">OK...</p>
    <p class="shopkeeper">Bye!</p>
    <p class="narrator">The player leaves the shop, excited to find out what he meant by the drone.</p>
    <p class="player">Lemme see if his friend could help...</p>
    <p class="narrator">The player calls the shopkeeper's friend.</p>
    <p class="player">What's good bro!</p>
    <p class="shopkeeperfriend">Hi!!</p>
    <p class="player">I have the second card, he said it had something to do with a drone.</p>
    <p class="shopkeeperfriend">A drone, huh?</p>
    <p class="player">Yep, a drone.</p>
    <p class="shopkeeperfriend">Come to my lab again, I'll show you what he means.</p>
    <p class="player">Coming!</p>
    <p class="narrator">The player arrives at the lab.</p>
    <p class="player">Okay, so about the drones, why did you bring me here?</p>
    <p class="shopkeeperfriend">You need me to activate the drone.</p>
    <p class="player">Why did that shopkeeper give me a broken drone anyway?</p>
    <p class="shopkeeperfriend">IDK, that's just him!</p>
    <p class="player">Now can you fix this thing up?</p>    
    <p class="shopkeeperfriend">Why not?</p>
    <p class="player">Great! Does it cost anything?</p>
    <p class="shopkeeperfriend">Yes. 100 points actually.</p>
    <p class="player">Oh wow! Pretty expensive...</p>
    <p class="shopkeeperfriend">I promise you it's totally worth!</p>
    <p class="player">OK, but just curious, can I buy many of these drones?</p>
    <p class="shopkeeperfriend">Nope, but you can upgrade this drone!</p>
    <p class="player">Great! Now, what's the max level?</p>
    <p class="shopkeeperfriend">You can upgrade only 5 times!</p>
    <p class="player">Oh, cool!</p>
    <p class="narrator">He pays 100 points. The shopkeeper's friend gives the drone to him.</p>
    <p class="player">OMG I'm <b>so</b> excited!!!</p>
    <p class="narrator">The next day...</p>
    <p class="player">OK, little drone-y, go and type for me!</p>
    <p class="narrator">The drone drives to the player's workplace and starts typing, but slowly.</p>
    <p class="narrator">Hours later, the boss calls the player.</p>
    <p class="boss">Excuse me, but why did some drone take your place today?</p>
    <p class="player">I just had to be creative, and no one said it's against the rules to do that!</p>
    <p class="boss">Wait what? I'm sure there was a rule about such thing...</p>
    <p class="narrator">The boss hurrily checks the rule book.</p>
    <p class="boss">OMG you're right!! What a creative person you are!</p>
    <p class="player">Ah thanks, bye!</p>
    <p class="boss">Bye!</p>
    <p class="narrator">The player hangs up.</p>
    <p class="boss">Wow what such creativity! If only everyone else did that...</p>
    <p class="narrator">Days pass. The player now uses the drone for work. What new cards will the player take now?To be continued...</p>
