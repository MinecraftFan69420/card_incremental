    <p class="narrator">
        The player character got a new job in the big city. He will be a software engineer. 
        He is doubtful at first, but his friend assures him he'll be fine. He then arrives. 
        His boss tells him he gets paid for every button press... it seems pretty weird, but OK.
    </p>
    <p class="narrator"> Now, the player is done with his work and is coming back home. In his car... </p>
    <p class="player">
        Gosh, this is tiring! I never knew how much typing I had to do! Life was so much easier
        back at the McDonalds... 
    </p>
    <p class="narrator">While driving, he notices a sign.</p>
    <p class="narrator">It read out: "Are you looking for your fortune? Buy these cards, and you'll get rich!"</p>
    <p class="player">It seems like someone set up shop here. Lemme see what's there.</p>
    <p class="narrator">(SCREECH) The player exits the car, and walks to the place of the sign.</p>
    <p class="narrator">He arrives, seeing a handsome man which is the shopkeeper.</p>
    <p class="shopkeeper">Well, well, well... another one! </p>
    <p class="player">Now, you look nice!</p>
    <p class="shopkeeper">Why wouldn't I? Anyways, how can I help you?</p>
    <p class="player">I saw a sign saying you sold some cards that make one rich, right?</p>
    <p class="shopkeeper">Of course! So, I have a few cards. Trust me, these prices are affordable.</p>
    <p class="player">Lemme call someone real quick.</p>
    <p class="narrator">The player calls his friend.</p>
    <p class="player">Bro, I'm at some shop which the shopkeeper says sells magical cards. Is it true?</p>
    <p class="playerfriend">Yeah... everyone buys cards from him nowadays.</p>
    <p class="player">Ah, cool. Bye!</p>
    <p class="narrator">The player hangs up.</p>
    <p class="player">I'd like that first card that costs 20 points.</p>
    <p class="shopkeeper">Insert your card here.</p>
    <p class="narrator">The player inserts his credit card.</p>
    <p class="player">Now, now, what does it do?</p>
    <p class="shopkeeper">It acts as a key to one of my friend's places.</p>
    <p class="player">How so?</p>
    <p class="shopkeeper">Magic. Trust me!</p>
    <p class="player">And how will I know where that place is supposed to be?</p>
    <p class="shopkeeper">Figure it out yourself...</p>
    <p class="narrator">Where does this key lead? Find out next time! To be continued...</p>
