# Orientation
This document is supposed to help new developers understand the code that they soon will be working
on at the Card Incremental Dev Team. Now, we shall proceed.

## The HTML files
This section focuses on the HTML files in the code.
### index.html
WIP

### The Lore folder
The story found in the Lore tab of the game, separated by chapters.

## The CSS files
Separate CSS files exist for the game window and the lore. 
### The style.css file at the main folder.
This file styles the content of the game.

## The JS file.
### default_player & player
From lines 1 to 36, there exists an object called *default_player*. This object shows what *player*
will be when the game starts. Also, when we want to reset the game, this object will aid in setting
all the values of *player* back into their defaults.

## The DEV ONLY folder
